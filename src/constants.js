    "The Bone Wars, also known as the 'Great Dinosaur Rush', refers to a period of intense fossil speculation and discovery during the Gilded Age of American history, marked by a heated rivalry between Edward Drinker Cope (of the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia) and Othniel Charles Marsh (of the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale). Each of the two paleontologists used underhanded methods to try to out-compete the other in the field, resorting to bribery, theft, and destruction of bones. Each scientist also sought to ruin their rival's reputation and cut off their funding using attacks in scientific publications.",

    "The Matrix defense is the term applied to several legal cases of a defense based on the Matrix films where reality is a computer generation—simulism—and that the real world is quite different from what reality is perceived to be. In using this defense, the defendant claims that they committed a crime because they believed they were in the Matrix, and not in the real world. This is a version of the insanity defense and considered a descendant of the Taxi Driver defense of John Hinckley, one of the first defenses based on blurring reality with films.",
